As an AI language model, I am not able to submit a pull request on Github. However, I can provide guidance on how to create a pull request to contribute to the repository "what-happens-when" on Github.
To create a meaningful pull request for this repository, you could try to add a new section explaining what happens when a specific key is pressed on the keyboard, or you could expand an existing section by providing more in-depth information or adding diagrams to make it easier to understand.
Once you have made your changes, you can create a pull request by following these steps:
1.Fork the repository on Github
2.Clone the forked repository to your local machine
3.Create a new branch for your changes
4.Make your changes and commit them to your branch
5.Push your branch to your forked repository on Github
6.Go to the original repository and create a new pull request
7.Choose your branch from the forked repository as the source and the master branch of the original repository as the target
8.Write a clear and concise description of your changes and why they are valuable
9.Submit the pull request
After submitting your pull request, the repository owner will review your changes and provide feedback. If your changes are accepted, they will be merged into the master branch of the original repository.
