This question is a classic and still widely used interview question for many types of software engineering position. It is used to assess a candidateâ€™s general knowledge of how the web stack works on top of the internet. One important guideline to begin answering this question is that you should ask your interviewer whether they would like you to focus in on one specific area of the workflow. For a front-end position they may want you to talk at length about how the DOM is rendering. For an SRE position they may want you to go into the load balancing mechanism.
This question is a good test of whether you understand DNS. Many software engineering candidates struggle with this concept, so if you do well on this question, you are already way ahead of the curve.
When you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter, the following series of events occurs:
1 .DNS Request:Your browser initiates a DNS request if there's no record of google.com ip in the cache of the browser and os to resolve the domain name "google.com" into an IP address.The DNS resolver processes the request and returns the IP address associated with "google.com".
2 .TCP/IP Connection:Armed with the IP address obtained from DNS resolution, your browser establishes a TCP connection to the server hosting "google.com".TCP ensures reliable communication by breaking data into packets, sending them, and reassembling them at the destination.
3 .Firewall:The TCP connection passes through firewalls, which monitor and filter incoming and outgoing traffic. The firewall checks for security threats or policy violations, ensuring only legitimate traffic passes through.
4 .HTTPS/SSL:Once the connection is established, your browser initiates an HTTPS connection by sending an HTTPS request to the server.HTTPS encrypts the data exchanged between your browser and the server using SSL/TLS protocols, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
5 .Load-Balancer:If Google employs load-balancing technology, your request may be directed to one of several backend servers.The load balancer distributes incoming requests across these servers to optimize performance and ensure high availability.
6 .Web Server:Upon receiving your HTTPS request, the web server hosting "google.com" processes it.The web server fetches the requested resources such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
7 .Application Server:In some cases, the web server communicates with an application server to fulfill your request.The application server executes complex business logic, interacts with databases, and generates dynamic content.
8 .Database:If your request involves fetching or manipulating data stored in a database, the application server interacts with the appropriate database server.The database server retrieves or updates the requested data and returns it to the application server for further processing.
